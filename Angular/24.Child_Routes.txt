whenever we want to view a route in another route the we make use use of child routes
Let suppose we wantr to display info and contact number of each dept then we need to create the child route.

1. geneterate 2 new Components

ng g c departmentoverview

ng g c dept-contact

in app.routing.module.ts

now we need to define the children property to the route to which we want to bind the child routes


so in
const routes : Routes = [
path :"departments/:id",
component : DepartmentDetailsComponent,
children : [
{path : "overview",component : DepartmentOverviwComponent},
{path : "dept-contact",component : DeptConatctComponent}
]
]


Add above components in componentList array and also import them

So for displaying them exactly in the view we make use of the router-outlet directive

so in  department-details.html

<router-outlet></router-outlet>

Add buttons to navigate to child routes

<button (click) = "Overview()"></button>
<button (click) = "contact()"></button>


Overview(){
this.router.navugate(['overview'],{relativeTo : this.route})
}

contact(){
this.router.navugate(['dept-contact'],{relativeTo : this.route})

}
