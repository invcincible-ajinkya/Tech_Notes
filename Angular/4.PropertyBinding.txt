Property Binding:
-It is the process of binding the DOM properties with the view.

  Attributes & properties are not same.
  Attributes are define by the HTML & properties by the DOM.
  Attributes initializes the properties and their values can't be changed once they are initialized.Property values can be changed.


create a new property:

    public myId : "tetsId"
    public isDisabled : true

So in the HTML:

    <div>
      <input type = text [id] = "myId" value = "Ajinkya">
      <input type = text [disabled] = "isDisabled" value = "Ajinkya">
    </div>

Alternative syntax: 

  use bind-propertyName
  public myId : "tetsId";

<div>
  <input type = text [bind-id] = "myId" value = "Ajinkya">
  <input type = text [bind-disabled] = "isDisabled" value = "Ajinkya">
</div>
