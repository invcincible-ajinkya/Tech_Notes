Interpolation: syntax <---> {{...}}
      -Interpolation is the syntax used in the angular for defining the property.
      -We can evaluate the value inside the component and render it in the view as the page loads.
      -It is the way of binding the data from the class to the template.

      -So let Suppose we want to display a name using the interpolation
          
          <div>  Wecome to {{title}} </div> 

          public title : "AJinkya..Pathak...";
      
      -We can also use the interpolation for
        1.Expressions : {{2+2}}
        2.string concatination :  {{"Welcome" + title}}
        3.Adding JS methods  :  {{title.lenth}} / {{title.toUpperCase()}}
        4.We can also use the method in the component :  {{title.welcome()}}

    Limitations :
        -Assignment is not possible :  {{a = 1+1}}    ///error
        -Access to global variables is not possible : {{window}}  //error
