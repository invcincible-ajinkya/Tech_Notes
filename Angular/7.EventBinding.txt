Event Binding : 
    -In order to have data flow from the template to the class we need to make use of the event binding.
    -We can listen various events such as mouseclicks keyPress and based on this we can make change in the class logic.
    -We can also bind the properties on the mouseclicks.
    -We can also get the information about the current event which has been fired. For ths we have to make use of "$event" variable.
    -This is a special variable in angular which gives the information about the current event which is fired.
    -We have to pass the "$event" variable as an argumnts to the function.It will give Access to the DOM events.
    -We can also assign the code in the event handler in the DOM element itself.


    template : `
    <button (click) = "greetUser($event)">Greet</buton>
    <button (click) = "Welcome to Angular">Greet</buton>

    <h2>{{printName}}</h2>
     `

style : [``]


  export class TestComponent {

    public printName = "";

    greetUser(event){
        console.log("Welcome Ajinkya");
        console.log(event);
        this.printName = "Ajinkya Pathak";
    }

  }
