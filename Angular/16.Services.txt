Services :
    A class with a specific purpose.
    We use it for sharing and providing data between the components.
    Also for implementing the logic into the application.
    Also used for external interaction.

    **Steps to create Services in Angular :
    
    1.Deifne the EmployeeService Class. (use command "ng g s EmployeeService")

       1a. //create the method to get EmployyeList in service.ts

        getEmployees() {
            return [
            { "id": 1, "name": "Ajinkay Pathak", "Company": "Hurix Systems" },
            { "id": 2, "name": "Amol Daware", "Company": "Atos-Syntel" },
            { "id": 3, "name": "Ajinkya Pathak", "Company": "Hurix Systems" },
            { "id": 4, "name": "Ajinkay Pathak", "Company": "Hurix Systems" },
            { "id": 5, "name": "Ajinkay Pathak", "Company": "Hurix Systems" }
            ];
           }

        1b.And initialize the empty array in the employeelist.ts class
                EMPLOYEES = []

    2.Register the service with th injector.

        2a. app.module.ts
            import { EmployeeServiceService } from './employee-service.service'
              providers: [EmployeeServiceService],


    3.Declare as the dependancy in the EmployeeList Component. Also known as dependancy injection.
       
        EmployeeList.ts

          constructor(private _employeeService: EmployeeServiceService) { }
            import { EmployeeServiceService } from './employee-service.service'

                ngOnInit() {
                  this.EMPLOYEES = this._employeeService.getEmployees();
                }
