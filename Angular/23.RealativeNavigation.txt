Till now we  are using the absolute paths for Navigation
An absolute path is one which starts with the '/' forwarsd slash.

With absolute path we have lack of flexibility.(suppose we want to change the route path then we need to change all the occurences of the path.
But with help of route navigation we can avoid this.)

so we use relative navigation to avoid above proble

in department-list.ts

onSelect(department){

this.router.navigate([department.id],{relativeTo : this route})

//It means whatever may be the URL. append the departmentId to the current route and then navugate to that URL
}


same in the departDetails.ts

goBack(){
this.router.navigate(['../'],{selectedId },{relativeTo : this.route})


//it means go back to the previous URL and remove the id from URL
}
