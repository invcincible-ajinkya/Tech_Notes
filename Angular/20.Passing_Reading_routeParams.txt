Steps:

1.Change the Dpartlist component by adding name and id to the object of the data

[
      {
        id: 1,
        "name": "Angular"
      },
      {
        id: 2,
        "name": "React"
      },
      {
        id: 3,
        "name": "Vue"
      },
      {
        id: 4,
        "name": "Mongo"
      },
      {
        id: 5,
        "name": "Java"
      }
    ];

2.Generate Department Details Component

ng g c DepartMentDetails

in app.routing.module.ts
    import { DepartmentDetailsComponent } from './department-details/department-details.component';

    //Add the object in the route array

    { path: "departments/:id", component: DepartmentDetailsComponent },

      "departments/:id"  ---> placeholder for the route Parameters. As we want to pass the id  so it named as "/:id"

3.Navigate to the route when we click on any department

in departmentList.html

    <li (click) = onSelect(dept)  *ngFor = "let dept of DEPARTMENTS">   //bind an onClick event for navigation

    in departmentList.ts

    import { Router } from '@angular/router';   ---> Added for writting the routing logic

    constructor(private _deptService: DepartmentService, private router: Router) { }  ---> inject it in constructor

    onselect(department) {

     //in this method we will navigate through the code
     //so we wiil make use of navigate() method.
     //argumnts to above method is link parameters array
     //This is the information that angular need to construct the URL.

        //1.[/departments] ---> it is the path that we want to navigate
        //2.department.id --> It is the route parameter that we want to read/pass

    this.router.navigate(['/departments',department.id]);


 }

 DepartMentDetails.ts

1. import { ActivatedRoute } from '@angular/route';   ---> we make use of it on order to read route para and display it in the view.

2.inject it into the constructor in order to have instance

constructor( private route : ActivatedRoute){

}

3.in ngOnInit(){} read the route para


ngOnInit(){
  //route service gives snapshot of currentRoute.
  // from this snapshot we use parammap api which help to get parameter from the URL
  //so in get method we will get the id parameter which we want.

  let id = parseInt(this.route.snapshot.paramMap.get('id'));

// assign the parameter to local variable.
  public departmentId = id;
}


4.now change the view / html

in DepartMentDetails.html

<h3> You selected the department with id = {{ departmentId }} </h3>
